# Network Sniffing and Encryption Challenge

## Overview
We have discovered an unsecured network where encryption keys used to protect highly sensitive documents may not always be generated using sufficiently large prime numbers. This vulnerability arises from improper key generation, making decryption a potential option. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these keys as quickly as possible before the target addresses this security flaw on their server, enabling us to decrypt the confidential documents.

## Requirements

### General
- **Programming Language:** You are free to choose the programming language of your preference.
- **Operating System:** Make sure your development environment is compatible with Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
